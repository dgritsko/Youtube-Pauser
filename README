This is a Chrome extension to automatically pause all YouTube videos that
are currently playing. The extension adds a "Pause" button to the Chrome
toolbar; when clicked, this button checks each tab for YouTube videos and
attempts to pause them.

Here's my use case -- if I'm listening to a song on YouTube and I've got many 
tabs open at once, I don't want to have to hunt for the YouTube tab if I want
to pause the music. Or worse, if I've got multiple YouTube tabs open, I don't
want to go hunting around for the tab in which audio is ACTUALLY coming from.

This extension aims to get rid of all of that by having one Pause button to 
rule them all. The initial version only works with videos directly YouTube, 
but in the future I'd like to support embedded videos and perhaps other 
sites as well.
